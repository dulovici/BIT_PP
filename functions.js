// 1. Write a program that calculates the maximum of two given numbers. 
// A = 5 b = 6 output: 6


// 2. Write a program that checks if a given number is odd.
// A = 3 output: odd

// 3. Write a program that checks if a given number is a three digit long number.

// 4. Write a program that calculates an arithmetic mean of four numbers.

// 5. Write a program that draws a square of a given size. For example,  if the size of square is 5 the program should draw: 
// *****
// *    *
// *    *
// *    *
// *****

// 6. Write a program that draws a horizontal chart representing three given values. For example, if values are 5, 3, and 7, the program should draw:
// * * * * *
// * * *
// * * * * * * *

// 7. Write a program that calculates a number of digits of a given number. 

// 8. Write a program that calculates a number of appearances of a given number in a given array.
// Inputs: a = [2, 4, 7, 8, 7, 7, 1], e = 7
// Result: 3

// 9. Write a program that calculates the sum of odd elements of a given array. 

// 10. Write a program that calculates the number of appearances of a letter a in a given string. Modify the program so it calculates the number of both letters a and A.

// 11. Write a program that concatenates a given string given number of times. For example, if “abc” and 4 are given values, the program prints out abcabcabcabc.
